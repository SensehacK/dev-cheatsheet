## Git Tokens

## Github Gist

Authentication Github Gist using “Github Desktop” didn’t work for me. My main password didn’t work so I created one more Github Token for just “Gist” permission.

And by opening iTerm2 via Github Desktop I was able to push the gist changes by entering my newly generate authorization token.
