## VNC Security Shenanigans 

Remote screen is Disabled by Security Profile push.
Ethernet/ Wifi configs have been modified too with an automatic proxy configuration via iBoss filtering or some other tool.
It runs on the background thread every 5 mins to make sure the config is set appropriately and enabled to point towards this proxy config `.pac` file.


No machine is only limited to 1 user per session on free edition.
It uses a different port with different protocol called `nx` on 4000. So its kinda a cat and mouse game at this point.
