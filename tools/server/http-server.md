To run a local server to host the website. As running a local server isn’t in the scope of this tutorial and also isn’t essential to it, it’s only briefly mentioned. 

If you have Python 3 installed, you can run the command 
```bash
python3 -m http.server -d $directory_name`
```

If your macOS doesn’t have Python, you can install it with homebrew 

```bash
brew install python3
```
