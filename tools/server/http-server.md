## Quick run

To run a local server to host the website. As running a local server isn’t in the scope of this tutorial and also isn’t essential to it, it’s only briefly mentioned. 

If you have Python 3 installed, you can run the command 

```bash
python3 -m http.server -d $directory_name`
```

If your macOS doesn’t have Python, you can install it with homebrew 

```bash
brew install python3
```


## Node

Create a quick server at the `$pwd` directory.

```sh
npx http-server --port 8001
```
