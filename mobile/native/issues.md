## Build Errors

### Cannot Generate C

Source of error and solving problem [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48928498/configure-error-c-compiler-cannot-create-executables-react-native#comment85298270_49032986)

So renaming “Xcode 10.0” to just “Xcode” without any spaces did the trick. Wasted my 40mins of time. Upgrading from Cocoapods, changing Xcode path, installing Developer tools via Xcode-install command.

Reading different solutions offered on Github and stack overflow.
