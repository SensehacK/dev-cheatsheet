## Intro

Coroutines are computer program components that allow execution to be suspended and resumed, generalizing subroutines for cooperative multitasking. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes. 

In addition to opening the doors to asynchronous programming, coroutines also provide a wealth of other possibilities, such as concurrency and actors.
