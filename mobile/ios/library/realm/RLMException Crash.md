# RLMException Crash


Same issue which I had with the project. I don't know anything about Realm but this thread did help me to fix the issue.

```
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'RLMException', reason: 'Object has been deleted or invalidated.'
terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException
```
