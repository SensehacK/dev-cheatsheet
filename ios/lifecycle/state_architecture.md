# State Architecture
## Introduction

State machine theory used for Swift architecture in order to communicate which state we are in currently for the views to be loaded / completed.
You can communicate actual intent of the current view in the app in the processing state, errored state, empty state or completed state.

You can see how we can use state architecture in a composable way to communicate different states of the current tasks the user is performing.
