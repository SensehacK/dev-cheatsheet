## dynamic

Keyword as `dynamic` added to give more context Swift runtime to use Objective-C dynamic dispatch. Mostly used Key Value observing.


## @objc
Very less experience in these scenarios.
`@objc` could be also tacked on to give access for Objective-C caller.
Method swizzling via Objective-C could be a scenario if it comes to my mind or Objective-C library dependencies - interoperability with swift.
`#selector` kind of thing.
