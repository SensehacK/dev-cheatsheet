# Travis CI

This is the script Iâ€™m using for building on Xcode Travis CI workflow. You could also refer to my older doc regarding TravisCI Timeline. [TravisCITimeline.md](traviscitimeline.md)

xcode_workspace: src/iOS/HealthSense/
xcode_scheme: HealthSenseCI
xcode_destination: platform=iOS Simulator,OS=13.3,name=iPhone 11


# Build the main app, which happens to depend on the test cases.
script: xcodebuild clean build test -workspace src/iOS/HealthSense/HealthSense.xcworkspace -scheme HealthSenseCI -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,OS=13.3,name=iPhone 11" ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO -skip-testing:HealthSenseUITests
