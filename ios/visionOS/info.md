## Vision OS Brief Info

## News 

Apple is gearing up towards releasing the hardware debut to everyone by Feb 2nd 2024
Pre‑order starting 1.19 at 5:00 a.m. PT 
Available starting February 2 Available starting 2.2

## Hardware

No Wi-Fi 6E or 7 chips in Apple Vision Pro unlike newer macbooks
Isn't a pro device if you are bundling a Wifi 6 in a $3.5K machine.

Also if you're playing video only, the previous battery estimate was 2 hours now it has increased to 2.5 hrs when using external battery pack.

Qualcomm yesterday unveiled the chip which will power Vision Pro competitors, the [Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/09/qualcomm-launches-its-next-generation-xr-and-ar-platforms--enabl).

### Pricing

Still $3500 for the Headset and if you're an Apple card holder you can have monthly installments but [Apple still hasn't provided any details on how many months it can be stretched out to without interest](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211204).

the [apple polishing cloth $19](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth) comes for free in the box.

## Enterprise

Apple has [shared an article for reimagining your enterprise apps for visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j368ftil)

### WebKit 

Finally apple has made a [bug tracking website for its WebKit Open source](https://bugs.webkit.org/) project. Now only if we can have open apple radar officially supported for developers.

### Immersive Web

apple list [WebXR Device API](https://immersiveweb.dev/) on their official visionOS developer page which is nice to see since this API is being adopted by other VR / AR OEMs for development. Only two Features are [current supported on Safari visionOS](https://immersiveweb.dev/#supporttable) [behind a feature flag](https://webkit.org/blog/14205/news-from-wwdc23-webkit-features-in-safari-17-beta/#webxr).


## Audio Video

3D content using MV-HEVC format supporting current HLS platform.
Playback supported to 4K 2160p till 90hz SDR | HDR.
The display's refresh rate is 90 Hertz but a special `96`hz / 4 for (24fps) video could be supported.

You can provide Spatial audio with backup stereo stream track. This is supported by current HLS specification but this hardware is a complete package.

### MultiMedia Content

150 3D Movies at launch

If you have Apple TV+ subscription you can watch recorded [music recording process in 180-degree 3D 8K recordings captured with Spatial Audio.](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/01/apple-tv-unveils-groundbreaking-immersive-originals-from-todays-biggest-storytellers-set-to-debut-on-apple-vision-pro/)

Other stuff being available at launch for visionOS, we can see [official Disney+ app on VisionOS (iPadOS) compatibility mode in Apple press releases](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-previews-new-entertainment-experiences-launching-with-apple-vision-pro/)

Several streaming apps, will offer 3D versions of their latest and most popular movies on Vision Pro at launch along with Spatial Audio and immersive Environment experiences.

## Apps

[vision pro Apps](https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/15/vision-pro-apps-available/)
[Xcode 15.2 releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15_2-release-notes) fixes a lot of visionOS bugs for simulator, so development experience should be more better.

[Persona feature](https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-persona-feature-beta/) is still in Beta phase

## Emulation

### xrOS / VisionOS on non apple hardware

You can emulate the Vision OS on xcode simulators on a mac. But what if you can't afford an actual headset. You can just get the unofficial recreation of visionOS for Meta Quest VR headset. [Github project link](https://github.com/JustinPBarnett/visionOS-Demo)

### VisionOS UIKit Prototype
Also if you want to prototype VisionOS app interfaces on other VR headsets, you can use this project for [Unity UIKit template](https://github.com/jetstyle/Apple-Vision-Pro-UI-Kit)


## Gaming

- Access to 250+ games with Apple Arcade
- Support for PS5 and Xbox wireless controllers (and others).

### No official Enthusiast Gaming support

Still no official gaming support for PC or direct input. I think so apple wants to control the ecosystem as always and not allow for more customizability.


Sad that micro-OLED tech used in apple vision hardware could be a game changer for gaming in general. Only Bigscreen Beyond has this for now.

Oculus Quest 3 seems the right choice for now with budget and Mixed reality options. It does have LCD display and is based on fork version of Android. So sideloading is a great option for anyone trying Android development.
