There's [Spatial Video Tool](https://blog.mikeswanson.com/spatial), which requires either a pair of Left and Right videos, or a stereoscopic (SBS/OU) file. So you need to convert your .mts files to either left and right files or stereoscopic. I've been using it with great success to convert my 3D movie library. I have either .iso of MVC blurays or MVC mkv remuxes, and have used Dvdfab to convert .iso to left/right files and BD3D2MK3D to convert to SBS (both Windows tools). But the file you're working with doesn't work with these tools, which is designed for 3D blurays.

You can also convert MVC mkvs using [this script](https://gist.github.com/Vargol/8a0fa221eeff67e51b813d6389cc9dcd) (which requires ffmpeg and [these tools](https://github.com/Vargol/h264-tools)) on both Mac/PC, but I couldn't get it to work with your file. I tried remuxing with ffmpeg to MP4 as well, but the script doesn't see it as a typical MVC file. So not sure. You need to figure out how to convert your files into left/right or SBS, then use the Spatial Video Tool. When I do mediainfo on your file, it has two video streams, it's not like my MVC files which is essentially both eyes combined into one MVC video stream.
