# Observations 


## Resources

The simulator is bit heavier and consumes lot of CPU cycles as well as more RAM. It always feels slower to run the app on simulator.




## WebView

Was not able to embed the webview in the app but it opens up a new tab and don't know how to switch back or close the webview after the token is being passed back to the app. Callbacks.

I noticed this is caveat.

## SwiftUI 

SwiftUI works just fine maybe have to learn a thing or two about dynamically resizable windows and frames to adjust the UI accordingly. So far I'm sticking with just the default OS implementation UI library to learn a thing or two.


## Xcode Beta
Feels sometimes buggy more often than not.
Haven't crash on me for using VisionOS simulator yet. So that's a plus.
