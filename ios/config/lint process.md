## Approach

Swift Linting locally (SPM) version locked or globally

Add linting checks early on in our process or late like AirUI

Pros 

Cons



AirUI team has senior engineers so its more better for them to add it later to the process.


## Comparison


Look at how many packages they have with so many updates for minor version updates.
