## HDCP 

HDCP is a form of DRM that's baked into the HDMI standard. If you're watching media that uses it on a device that isn't compliant, you'll get a black screen. I have a splitter that I use to strip it myself because I have have one of those cheap Chinese projectors, and my cable box refuses to work with it otherwise.
