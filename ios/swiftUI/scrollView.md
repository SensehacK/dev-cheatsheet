Scrollview gives us the flexibility of having scrollable UI element views inside it.
That way the user can get more information inside the view and able to also parse more details internally rather than truncating information altogether.

```swift
ScrollView {
	Rectangle()
	Circle()
		.frame(width: 400)
}
```
