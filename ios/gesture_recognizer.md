# Gesture Recognizer

## Label Tap Gesture

To work with tap gesture: 1. Add UITap gesture from storyboard “+”. Link it to the label or any element which doesn’t have “Action”. 2. Make sure enable User Interaction settings in storyboard or programmatically. 3. Link the UITap gesture in Assistant layout and drag the IBAction func with sender as UITapGestureRecognizer type. 4. Voila done using storyboard.
