# Dispatch Main

## Info

Serial Queue but async execution if `async` is being used. Usually the prefered option.
Usually needed for the system to switch threads 
eg. Network call -> Background thread
-> Jump/Transit to Main thread for UI updating tasks.


### Warnings

Xcode by default has main thread checker enabled which is a good thing and lets us quickly fix the issue while building the project using simulators.

Settings could be found in  Xcode Product scheme -> Run -> Diagnostics ->
`Main thread Checker` 

Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed; make sure to publish values from the main thread (via operators like receive(on:)) on model updates.

## UIKit

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async  {
	self.tableView.reloadData()
}
```


## Combine

### Publishers
Sending values from Publishers

```swift
.subscribe(on: DispatchQueue.global())
```

### Subscriber

Sink receive values when we are subscriber / observer

```swift
.receive(on: Runloop.main) 

.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
```


Runloop.main - User interaction | UI gestures will pause changes | execution of code 

```text
Updating your UI while scrolling might affect the frames per second (FPS) and smooth scrolling. It could be that your UI update isnâ€™t as necessary when the user is scrolling. In that case, it might make sense to opt-in to using RunLoop.main as a scheduler. - avanderlee
```


DispatchQueue.main - User interaction won't pause the execution.

## RxSwift

RxSwift equivalents [[Observe]]

### Observe Publisher

```swift
.subscribe(on: MainScheduler.instance)
.subscribe(on: MainScheduler.asyncInstance)
```

### Subscriber / Observer

```swift
.observe(on: MainScheduler.asyncInstance)
.observe(on: MainScheduler.instance)
```
Custom Queue scheduler
```swift
let scheduler = SerialDispatchQueueScheduler(queue: DispatchQueue.main, internalSerialQueueName: "CustomQueue")
.observe(on: scheduler)
```

## SwiftUI

```swift
@MainActor
class CustomClass: ObservableObject {
	@Published var data: [Data] = []

	init() { fetchData() }

	func fetchData() {
		
		data = await URLSession.shared.data(url: "https://sensehack.github.io/")
	}
}
```
