# String

## Manipulation


## Substring

## Print

Printing boolean values in print statement wasnâ€™t straight forward as I believed it was.
So we can encapsulate the boolean value in string and print it.

## nth element
Very useful thread for getting character of string in swift, playing with its index values rather than just value of the string character.

## Computed string _ closure 

Pass parametric property like behavior but Swift doesn't allow for parameters to be passed to properties. So we would use function - closure(nameless function) to achieve the same goal.
```swift
var image_: (String) -> String {
	{ "image-\($0)" }
}
// Call
print(image_("3"))
```
