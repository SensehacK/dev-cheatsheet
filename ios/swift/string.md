# String

## Manipulation


## Substring

```swift
let quote = "The revolution will be Swift"
let substring = quote.dropFirst(23)
let realString = String(substring)
```

## Print

Printing boolean values in print statement wasnâ€™t straight forward as I believed it was.
So we can encapsulate the boolean value in string and print it.

## nth element

Very useful thread for getting character of string in swift, playing with its index values rather than just value of the string character.



```swift
let input = "Kautilya Save"
let char = input[input.index(input.startIndex, offsetBy: 0)]
print(char) // K

// Extension method
print(input[0] input[9]) // KS

```

You can also use an extension for it. [extensions Character nth element](ios/lifecycle/extensions.md)

## Range

## Computed string _ closure 

Pass parametric property like behavior but Swift doesn't allow for parameters to be passed to properties. So we would use function - closure(nameless function) to achieve the same goal.
```swift
var image_: (String) -> String {
	{ "image-\($0)" }
}
// Call
print(image_("3"))
```


## Expressible Literals

Good article about what they are and how they are used.

## Performance

String concatenation `+` is faster than `\(string_variable)` in the code according to this below document.

```swift
let name = "Kautilya"
let str1: String = "Hi! my name is \(name)"
let str2: String = "Hi! my name is " + name
```
