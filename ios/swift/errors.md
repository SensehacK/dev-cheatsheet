## Implementation

### Enum based

The simplest approach is probably to define _one_ custom `enum` with just one `case` that has a `String` attached to it:

```swift
enum MyError: Error {
    case runtimeError(String)
}

extension MyError: LocalizedError {
	var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
	    case .runtimeError(let str):
		    "RunTime Error: \(str)"
        }
    }
}
```

Example usage would be something like:

```swift
func someFunction() throws {
    throw MyError.runtimeError("some message")
}
do {
    try someFunction()
} catch MyError.runtimeError(let errorMessage) {
    print(errorMessage)
}
```

If you wish to use existing `Error` types, the most general one would be an `NSError`, and you could make a factory method to create and throw one with a custom message.


### Struct based

Or use another approach 

```swift
struct RuntimeError: LocalizedError {
    let description: String

    init(_ description: String) {
        self.description = description
    }

    var errorDescription: String? {
        description
    }
}
```



And to use:

```swift
throw RuntimeError("Error message.")
```

## NS Error

Information about an error condition including a domain, a domain-specific error code, and application-specific information.

## Exception


> Use [`NSException`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexception) to implement exception handling. An exception is a special condition that interrupts the normal flow of program execution. Each application can interrupt the program for different reasons. For example, one application might interpret saving a file in a directory that is write-protected as an exception. In this sense, the exception is equivalent to an error. Another application might interpret the userâ€™s key-press (for example, Control-C) as an exception: an indication that a long-running process should abort.
