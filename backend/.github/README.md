# Sensehack Developer Cheatsheet

## Intro

This is just personal documentation or cheatsheet with personal examples for easy reference in future projects.

As sometimes, we would have limited internet access or restrictive data download policies. Personal Git documentation for specific programming languages, libraries & frameworks help a lot to quickly absorb the problem statement and work swiftly :P

## Content

Development Hell and most of CLI inputs used with bit of documentation so I’m not totally dependent on my Firefox Browser or my One Note / iA Writer App for accessing my documents on different terminal. I can just git clone this repository and boom we are up to date with my personal wiki or documentation.

Content would include :

* Different issues I have faced.
* Boilerplate Code
* Deprecated or obsolete commands or code flow
* Timeline of features
* Easy syntax

## Projects

Currently I have 2 repositories for learning of my IONIC Angular development with Cordova for building Hybrid Apps.
