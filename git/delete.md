# Git Delete


## Last local commit 
 
If you have committed some files and still not pushed to cloud git server you can still hard reset the head to remove that commit and history too.

> git reset --hard HEAD^ 

Also next git push wonâ€™t commit the deleted commit and also you will lose the commit changes progress so make sure you have your work stashed or saved off to some folder or file.
