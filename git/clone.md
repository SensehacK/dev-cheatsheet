# Clone | Checkout | Fetch | Pull
 


## Description

We are at this step of Software Development hell. Git checkout configurations. Some say the hardest thing in development is naming the variables meaningful and configuring your workstation with appropriate fine grain authorization.
If the project has been configured appropriately by a senior engineer or a security team, it should be as a fool proof as possible to not have any destruction by anyone who knows nothing about code versioning.


## Getting Started

First task would be setting up your workstation with appropriate credentials using `https` or `ssh` based approach in order for you to clone the code.

I recommend `ssh` approach and you can refer to my [guide here](../os/linux/ssh.md#Generate%20Key)
After that you can add that key to your [git cloud provider here](../os/linux/ssh.md#Adding%20Key) 

## Syntax

```sh
git clone repoURL/repoProject.git
```
