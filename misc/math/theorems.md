## [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)

In computing, endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory 

Wiki quick reference

> Big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols, such as in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"), where it is referred to as _network order_, transmitting the most significant byte first. Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures ([x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86"), most [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture") implementations, base [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V "RISC-V") implementations) and their associated memory. [File formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format "File format") can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both or contain an indicator of which ordering is used throughout the file.
