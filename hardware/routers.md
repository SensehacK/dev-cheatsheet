## Intro

- WiFi -> Wireless Fidelity

## Notes

- Always mention it as Access Points not a Wifi router
- 

## Two types of Access points

###  Home / Personal
- Arris
- Tplink
- Netgear

### Enterprise

- Cisco
- Rukus
- Extreme
- Aruba
- CMBian



## AP Testing

- Testing access points
- Any device which is capable of Wifi - you can test.



## Test Cases

- Manual testing - no programming required
- If Wifi Automation Testing  - Added advantage

### Device types Testing
Devices are referred as clients. 
Access points is the server 
Client - Server architecture

- iOS 
- Android


## Testing Tools

- Wireshark - Network Sniffer (free)
- Omni Peek https://www.liveaction.com/products/omnipeek/ (Paid, enterprise)
- fluke air check (scan SSIDs )
- Wifi analyzer
- Wifi Site survey 
	- Air magnet 
	- Ekahu


Project Management
- JIRA - KanBan
- Free tool (Gitlab, Github Projects, Trello)


## History

- We moved from Ethernet -> Wifi
- Move around - seamless connectivty
- Security aspect - wifi sniffing - catching the packets.



## Security

- Wireless Fidelity is little bit easier compared to Ethernet for snooping network packets.



## Terminologies

### SSID

## 2.4 Ghz

- Non overlapping channels
- What channels AP shouldn't be using
- What DFS channels are using
- 20 mhz how many channels:?
- In 40 mhz how many channels
- 11 channels I believe in 2.4ghz
- 1 , 6 and 11 are loosely coupled with least interference. 
- Better coverage
- Penetrates better through solid files
- It is legacy and more optimized overall.
- Enterprise AP connected Wifi routers 2.4 ghz is more suitable.

## 5 Ghz
- Lower coverage
- Faster transfer rates
- Can penetrate lesser
- Suited for 4K or higher bit rate content. 
- 

## RF

##

### 80 11

#### ax

### Radio Patterns

- two or three patterns
- 22 mhz channel range usual range.
- Auto setting to select specific channels most of the time on router admin page.

### Exempted Frequencies

- Also certain radio frequencies are always restricted for Federal for aviation and other security stuff.
- 

### Site Surveys

- How the AP are deployed
- Signal strength - Heat Map
- Channels in the picture - picking the right auto channel.

### Collision Detection / Avoidance



## Radio Frequency Isolation

- RF Boxes 
	- Antennas from one box to another chamber box. For isolated tests

- RF Chamber
	- Laptop can take control of doing speed tests, channels to access outside the chamber
	- External AP access, without being in the chamber. Security, throughput, channel width
	- Present onsite in a lab for testing.

- Screen rooms

- Brands 
	- Ramsey shield box RF shield box.
