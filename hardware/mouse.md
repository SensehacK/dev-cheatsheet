Oh I figured it out, you can assign one button to `g-shift` & then assign the toggle macro (mission_control_left) Macro (Ctrl + left arrow) to that `gshift` view.
Feels nice to have mac OS like productivity tools.


### Mx Master 3


amazing hardware & great for both windows & mac or if you have multiple devices like 3 slots.
bad usb A receiver, common its freaking 2021 - 2025.

work - mouse, amazing customizability

macros - `Command + Q` to quickly quit macOS apps


## Razer

Good lightweight mice for gaming

Razer synapse or bad macOS driver / or no software support whatsoever.
