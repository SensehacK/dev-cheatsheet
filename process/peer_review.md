# Peer Review


## Smaller Git Diff


We should look into making a change-set guideline so that changes like this could only show 2 lines change. rather than 4 lines due to order differences.
Your software architect or senior software engineers in your team can pitch in for a better way to standardize these commit policies.

Less change-set or git diff the better readability for the reviewer -> Which in turn would help us review concise and faster peer reviews. Is what I think, let me know what you guys think.
