## Intro

Always nice to create a project from scratch and gives us lot of opportunities to not make the same mistakes from the legacy projects.



## Code Linter

Early addition in the project is very much beneficial

### Advantages
- Defining a code structure early on will be easier and less clutter free with extra commits in SDLC to add miscellaneous cleanup / format commits. 
- Avoids dirtying up the git history 
- Can be a little bit daunting task to do git diffs or rollbacks or pinpoint git commits if we choose to go with that route every so often in a bug chase hunt. This would essentially save some time.
