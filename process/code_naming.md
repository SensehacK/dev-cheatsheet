## File Naming


Maybe we can follow a file naming convention for protocol only file to always append `+Protocol.swift`. Makes it easier when doing quick search on xcode to not open protocol files when you don't want to.

So instead of 
```swift
// Old
// AuthorizerDelegate.swift
public protocol AuthorizerDelegate { }

// New
// AuthorizerDelegate+Protocol.swift
```
