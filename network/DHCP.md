## DHCP 

- Client will send DHCP discover and AP sends and assigns an IP address back.
- DHCP server will assign internal IP address range table

Most routers will allow for DHCP reservation, get the device's MAC and give it any IP you want. 
Note: This will only work if the device doesn't have a static IP already set. If the device has a static IP set, it ignores what the DHCP server offers.
