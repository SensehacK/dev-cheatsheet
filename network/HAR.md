## Intro


The HAR format **enables you to export detailed information about network requests**. In addition to the Copy and Save menu items for HAR in the context menu, similar menu items are available in the HAR dropdown menu in the toolbar, as well as an Import menuitem.

## Compatibilty

You can open the `.har` file in  [proxyman](proxyman.md), since I prefer this tool over the bloated or old age boomer charles logs or even chrome tools etc., 

I just need a native mac experience where it has dark mode support and prettier hi-res icons :)
