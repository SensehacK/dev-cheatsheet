# Registry

## Remove Navigation Apps

For me I hate nuances like Dropbox app creating a new link in navigation panel of windows explorer. Without removing that specific tab.

We can do that by editing the registry, which is quite cumbersome but we are on windows so ease of access ship has sunk long while back.
