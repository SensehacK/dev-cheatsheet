ssh username@10.0.0.11 -vvvvA

Providing `-vvvvA` will give you debug logs for ssh connection.

## Auto SSH

It is like a daemon to monitor the service / like a watchdog to restart the service if it crashes or stops abruptly.

## netrc

Auto Login | netrc
The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process. It generally resides in the userâ€™s home directory, but a location outside of the home directory can be set using the environment variable `NETRC`. Both locations are overridden by the command line option -N. The selected file must be a regular file, or access will be denied.

[curl netrc information](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc.html)

For us using the netrc file does the trick. But note that besides:

```swift
machine github.com
  login <username>
  password <personal access token>
```

You also need to add this if your Package.swift points to binaries stored in GitHub package registry:

```swift
machine maven.pkg.github.com
  login <username>
  password <personal access token>
```

Took me quite a while to figure this out, but sub domains are not included in the machine definitions, so specify them individually.
