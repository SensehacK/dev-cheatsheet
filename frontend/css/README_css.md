# CSS

## Intro

This is just personal documentation or cheatsheet with personal examples for easy reference in future projects.

As sometimes, we would have limited internet access or restrictive data download policies. Personal Git documentation for specific programming languages, libraries & frameworks help a lot to quickly absorb the problem statement and work swiftly :P

Listing my snippets and easy reference methods for html usage. With few tips and my past experience with it so that it could be easily reusable and makes my prototyping easy and clean without doing more search every time Iâ€™m trying to achieve similar functions in new projects.
