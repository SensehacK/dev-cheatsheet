# Markdown Basics

## Extension

On VSCode
Use Markdown Lint for linting purposes.
Also Markdown All in One for everything else Markdown stuff.

Note: After manually fixing most of the linting stuff on my old cheat sheets and project README files. I thought I need to check for any way of just format on save type of option fixing the markdown lint suggestions like how prettier or beautify plugin works with eslint or tslint on vscode.
To my surprise if we press command palette of vscode
"Fix supported markdown lint violations in the document" Option does what I just described.
But "Format Document" in the right context menu of vscode when *.md* file is open after installing those markdown plugins doesn't work as doing actual formatting.
