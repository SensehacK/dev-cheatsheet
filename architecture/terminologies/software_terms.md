# Software Terms

## Intro

Being in high level software architecture meetings, I decided to sketch these acronyms or terminologies used daily while describing a problem / solution. Its continuously growing and easy to track my learnings as well just copy / paste it to someone who needs this reference.



## Architecture

## Mobile


## Compilers

### LLVM

[Xcode CLI | llvm tool](ios/xcode/build#Commands)

## Network

### Socket

Definition: A socket is **one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network**. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
