# Facade pattern

## Intro

When you have abstraction in place to make sure that certain thing could be carried out but you don't know the general specifics of its implementation under the hood. 
So you place a facade in that callsite and just assume work or certain tasks / preparations have been taking place in the background which isn't oblivious to the front consumer or onlooker. Thus the facade pattern. It derives from actual civil architecture nomenclature.  Houses having a great facade.




### Tangent

I usually use this to describe human beings, since they are nicer when things are good ( putting up a facade ) but internally they are who they are.
But that's psychology and I don't practice that legally. :P 
My two bits `1 0`  advice to everyone.
