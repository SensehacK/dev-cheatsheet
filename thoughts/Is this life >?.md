## Context
While I was waiting for my build to work on Jenkins CI 

## Text

Clearing out cache and hoping that the next build will build fine >?

Xcode + checksums + terminals + inaccessible directories which are hidden by default

For all its worth if it builds on Jenkins CI and then there would be access token issues

After that the migration of new repos

Then we migrate the main repo to Github Enterprise

then we migrate from Jenkins CI to Github Actions

We are in the process of migration from Nexus to ARtifactory

Is Software just an elaborate plan of cycle - migration

Are we all in a while (true) { } loop for infinity

Does god exist?

`sudo rm -rf project_name_directory` solves all the problems eh ?!

start it fresh with a new coat of paint

We are gonna use the latest and greatest

migration from mono repo to poly repo and again back to mono repo

migration from single service to micro service to back again at single service

Its just a trend in a loop

JS is trash - JS is cool - JS is trash (WebGL) is the future
