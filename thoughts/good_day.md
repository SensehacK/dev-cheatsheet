# Good Day

## Apple Dev

Today was a good day
Inspired by Ice Cube - Today was a good day

- Xcode SPM build no issues
- No git local merge conflicts 
- Even git remote cloud xcode `.xcodeProj` no merge conflicts
- xcode didn't even crash today
- xcode not stuck on `Resolving Package Graph`
- swift unit tests passed on the first run
- whatever xcode / swift build CLI command I typed - ran successfully on the first time
- No provisioning profile non-sense
- No certificates expired
- no code-signing issues
- no framework linking issues
- No iOS physical device hard wired connection issue
- Wireless deploy also worked on first try
- apple documentation helped me for the first time
- no need to clear git WIP files
- clean merge from `feature` -> `develop` -> `main`
- SDLC ticket automation
- Even the CI/CD nightly build just ran successfully
- no need to switch to rosetta simulator
- even tickets are automatically updated by Git Bots
- CI/CD fastlane is running beautifully.
- No CI/CD issues
- No pings from the Agile team to update the board
- No bugs reported from the product
- no slack mentions in the morning and evening
- Swift UI code worked on the first try
- even dynamic scaling worked without trial and error
- xcode refactor button worked flawlessly
- I didn't have to nuke carthage/cocoapods/swift package manager cache
- Didn't have to delete Derived Data or Xcode -> Clean Build
- My Merge | Pull Request got 2 approvals without `Requested code change`
- Didn't have to use my `rm -rf` destructive / nuke command as well
- No questions about which xcode and tool versions I'm on
