All of my media consumption history. [Tracktv](https://trakt.tv/users/sensehack)

## Movies

Movies where they make sure audio design, cinematography and engagement is prioritized. I don't care about the story since storywriters are different and actors are different.

## TV Shows

I love tv shows since it can convey time and character development. Not everything in life is perfect in that 2 hour movie screen where the hero always wins. I love to see any main character's progression or how the plot line moves. I hate Cliffhanger tactics and Game of Thrones style writing where unrelated events happen just to hype about certain things.
Good world building is crucial in TV shows and only few authors have even come close to building it right. 

### Fanboying | Tangent 

One of those authors is Eichira Oda - Creator of One Piece. 
If you love geopolitics, society, civics, history, geography, economics, world building, emotion, drama, philosophy, wars, technology, comedy. Basically every imaginable genre you want to have. If you know things about certain topic you can reference them in this show. From Dinosaurs, Robots, Notable political figures, artists, slavery, war crimes, traditions, mythology. Everything is covered.
If you liked Lord of Rings world building and scale. One Piece is atleast 5x of that world building.

## Art

Love vincent vangough, Monet. I'm not very knowledgable about Art but I still appreciate their thought process when they are painting or conveying something.

## Music

Huge fan of Rap, since I believe good music with good beats requires poetry. Few of my favorite artists - Eminem, J.Cole, Notorious B.I.G, Big Daddy Kane, Kendrick, JayZ, Nas.

Outside of rap genre I also enjoy rock, jazz, pop. My current listening history on [lastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/Sensehack)
