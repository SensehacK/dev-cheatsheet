All of my media consumption history. [Tracktv](https://trakt.tv/users/sensehack)

## Movies

Movies where they make sure audio design, cinematography and engagement is prioritized. I don't care about the story since storywriters are different and actors are different.

## TV Shows

I love tv shows since it can convey time and character development. Not everything in life is perfect in that 2 hour movie screen where the hero always wins. I love to see any main character's progression or how the plot line moves. I hate Cliffhanger tactics and Game of Thrones style writing where unrelated events happen just to hype about certain things.
Good world building is crucial in TV shows and only few authors have even come close to building it right. 

### Fanboying | Tangent 

One of those authors is Eichira Oda - Creator of One Piece. 
If you love geopolitics, society, civics, history, geography, economics, world building, emotion, drama, philosophy, wars, technology, comedy. Basically every imaginable genre you want to have. If you know things about certain topic you can reference them in this show. From Dinosaurs, Robots, Notable political figures, artists, slavery, war crimes, traditions, mythology. Everything is covered.
If you liked Lord of Rings world building and scale. One Piece is atleast 5x of that world building.

## Art

Love vincent vangough, Monet. I'm not very knowledgable about Art but I still appreciate their thought process when they are painting or conveying something.

## Music

Huge fan of Rap, since I believe good music with good beats requires poetry. Few of my favorite artists - Eminem, J.Cole, Notorious B.I.G, Big Daddy Kane, Kendrick, JayZ, Nas.

Outside of rap genre I also enjoy rock, jazz, pop. My current listening history on [lastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/Sensehack)

## Copyright Rant

Specific example with Youtube - DL. As far I understood youtube videos aren't DRM enabled.

I don't support downloading copyrighted videos, I just like to store them for educational purposes. Having them offline & readily available without any buffering or network constraints is really helpful in some circumstances like learning some skill off youtube while you're in airplane or at a remote location. Having your own playlists downloaded or synced locally could help you be productive without your reliance on internet.
Also as long as you are viewing any video in a web browser with appropriate DRM software installed. Even when watching videos you're essentially downloading them. So most of the service providers can't differentiate this on web. They can throttle the speed if you're querying too many network requests but I hardly find that is the case. Sometimes it will send you lots of fragmented data to make sure you're sending too many requests or make the UX little bit bad for people mining the website. Those are just preventive DOS attacks tools enforced by any Site reliability engineer or network engineer at different infrastructure networks. You may also get a Captcha or some kind of human intervention system. Google may try to serve you extra interruptions if you use `Firefox` or you aren't signed in the google account. It is their way of making sure bots aren't making tons of network requests.
It will always be a cat & mouse game and in order to understand underlying mechanisms you need to work from both perspectives.
Also for 99.50% they won't bother tinkering with their systems and User experience as they won't have the technical chops to follow through the article or research paper. So big companies won't fight too much for developers, engineers or technical users.
I can write quite a few articles on DRM and why it is bad in the overall space & creates a bad UX all around for people who want to access stuff legally. Remember everyone starts around with good side but they get tired and switch to Dark side `Anakin` Star Wars alter ego, **Darth Vader**
