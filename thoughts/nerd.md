## Economy

This drives innovation, of course lot of other factors are present but I can't deny how globalization and open trade changed the way every other country operates. It streamlined efficient operations and encourages more collaboration. World is much closer than it was 100 years ago. Of course with economics there comes Geopolitics as well with trade wars, not conforming to open trade, stifling innovation in capitalistic environment.


## Immigration Rants

It is what it is! I take my cup half empty | half full ideology with being happy there is a cup to drink the beverage by. Rather than debating whether it is empty or full.
Always greatful for the opportunity this country has presented.

## Energy

Renewable energy is good to begin with but transition from Coal, Fracking Natural gas to Renewable is gonna take some time. I support Nuclear energy and not closing them this quickly since we should rely on them for the next 15 years to make the transition efficient as possible.

Hydrogen powered vehicles and net negative smart houses are great to have as well. Not just buying an electric car and using Coal, Natural gas converted electricity to power your car won't make a difference. Replacing your old gas ICE cars with an electric car strains the environment with Carbon Dioxide as well.
Hopefully we have miniature nuclear power plants and hydrogen energy. Future looks good for efficient energy.
Switch from Gas and Coiled power cooktops to induction based cooktops. Energy efficient. As well as air conditioners with heat pumps.
