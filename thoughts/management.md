Just because one woman can make a baby in nine months doesn’t mean that nine women can make a baby in one month

## Tech Outsourcing

```
Hi, yes we were not able to proceed yesterday because we are missing the knowledge on how to open the IDE. Can you please schedule a knowledge transfer session with our team? Please keep in mind that there is only one hour left of the business day in our time zone. Also Marc, one of our senior devs, was missing information in his user story because he did not work with functions in his former projects. Could you please call him for clarification so he can proceed with his task?

## Indian IT Words

This is not promoting any self hate or hate towards a specific group of ethnicity. It's just I find this funny as I grew up partly in India & I have heard this corporate lingo / speak from middle managers working in IT companies.

Also for context this is an evolution from the British English and when they left we Indians who were a bit literate enough to read and write english came up with stop gaps to bridge our various native language dialects mixed in with english counterparts.
Now I still find it funny but since I have the context behind the native languages of India (Marathi, Hindi .etc.,) I get why these things are the way they are. But for a normal person this just sounds absurd & I go out of my way to use them to promote some "stereotypes".

"Kindly revert" - as in, 'please reply' to my email.

"Discuss about" - instead of simply 'discuss'

"Do one thing" - followed by a long list of multiple things to do. It's an odd Indian phrase that is grammatically wrong, and really has no meaning outside of Indian English.

"Prepone" - Taking the prefix pre\post and applying it to the word 'postpone'. So, prepone would be to move something sooner.

"Updation" - instead of just 'update' or instead of 'to be updated'. As well as generally adding the -tion suffix to alot of things.

"Take" - Often will say they are 'taking something' rather than 'doing something'. "Take a rest". "Take a meeting". "Take a backup".

In addition there are the physical mannerisms. Such as the Indian head-bob.

## The Pareto principle

The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").

## Good Manager


Identify a bad manager in an interview

1) They look visibly uninterested.  
2) They don't follow what you say properly and maintain a poker face.  
3) Because of 2, they can derail you even if you ask the right question.  
4) Their answers are vague/wrong if you want to clarify something.  
5) They can get egoistic out of insecurity for no fault of your own.  
6) Ironically, most of them start very friendly “Do you want to have water or eat something? Relax… This is a friendly two-way conversation”
