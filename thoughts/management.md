Hi, yes we were not able to proceed yesterday because we are missing the knowledge on how to open the IDE. Can you please schedule a knowledge transfer session with our team? Please keep in mind that there is only one hour left of the business day in our time zone. Also Marc, one of our senior devs, was missing information in his user story because he did not work with functions in his former projects. Could you please call him for clarification so he can proceed with his task?
