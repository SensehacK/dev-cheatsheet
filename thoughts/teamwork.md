## delegating task


> i really dislike having to have these discussions about a team member. I'm trying to give him meaningful work and an opportunity to grow and mix that in with the straighforward tasks as well. But when you don't even do a great job on the straightforward tasks (checking your tests, making sure you can build, etc) then I can't trust you with more interesting, challenging work, especially when deadlines are tight - wise person 



## Notifying

>  Thanks for bringing that to notice. Will let "our manager / scrum master" know about this

I always have an informal opinion on this.
