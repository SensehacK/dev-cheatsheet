Good post on blind copied below about PIPs at amazon in general.

> As a former Leader at AWS, here is my advice on PIPs . . . 
> 1. The best way to avoid a PIP is to move to another team every 2 years. They won’t PIP you the first year and, unless you really suck, probably won’t PIP you the second year. But start looking in your second year. 
> 2. It’s almost IMPOSSIBLE to survive a PIP. So you are better off spending your time interviewing for another job. Though if another team really wants to hire you, they can mid-PIP but it takes a bit of work on the hiring manager’s part and they have to get director level approval. 
> 3. Don’t take it personally. They are forced to PIP 5% minimum every year and each manager has to “take their turn” no matter how awesome their employees are. 
> 4. Use AWS as a career bootstrap. Don’t plan on staying there indefinitely. Bezos literally said that anyone there over 5 years was a liability. The entire AWS machine was built for turnover. Add it to your resume and move on.
