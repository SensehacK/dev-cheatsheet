## Disclaimer

Hey, I have a conflict of Interest in my opinions here. In no way, I'm hoping that United States of America or any other country will fix immigration to benefit an immigrant. 
But the more you read about this stuff, makes you more disappointed or adopt `nihilism` regarding this topic / category. But I still wanted to share my "intrusive" thoughts on it as I don't want to be labelled as `conservative` if or when I do get legal permanent status in USA or any other developed country. 

It is playing on Stereotypes as well. Monty Python, Blackadder, South Park style - self deprecating humor.

Would I be un-employable? I don't know but my intention of this write-up is not to promote hate but just share what people do think in their minds. Maybe writing this out kinda could be packaged as `spreading hate / stereotypes` but hey a good lawyer can represent a case from both sides and still win.
Hope A.I doesn't use this data to form stereotypes in their own learnings, well significant amount of data on internet has already riddled with crappy A.I generated text or content, so I don't think I'm actually making it more bad.

P.S: I do believe I'm not a racist, sexist or whatever variant I'm missing in psychology. Irrespective of how I wrote this article, it's definitely not Political correct (PC culture) but I grew up in a third world country (developing nation) and to me addressing few things upfront is still beneficial than not addressing the elephant in the room. 

## Indian born

Don’t move to US. It’s like you are born in India you wait 80 years to get green card whereas a other countries gets it in 6-18 months.

Don't hate the player, hate the game??

## Indian Management

### Manager 

You know what I'm referencing about. Everyone in tech has had some past experience with it. I'm not gonna say what they are but just mentioning that in this thought process is enough for anyone to read between the lines.

[Funny words Indians use in IT](thoughts/management#Indian%20IT%20Words)

### Leaders


> Indian tech leaders only hire Indian staff.


## Cartels

Now this will irk more people from specific states of India but this is the stuff people know but would chose to not address / speak about it. I chose not to bring it up but I prefer to provide / disclose information / prejudice which I'm aware, self reflect and also share how things are being done overall from my perspective or from informal water cooler talks to intoxicated people at your nearby communities.

Not to oust any specific state from India, we usually have two cartels in USA.
1. Gujju Cartel (People from Gujurat state)
2. Telugu Cartel (People from Telegana & Andhra Pradesh state)

### Gujurati

These people are usually the ones who owns all the Liquor, Gas Stations, Motels,  Mom & Pop Grocery stores in your area. Predominately they are more in New Jersey and few other major Cities. 
They are very apt people & pride themselves to be `business` oriented.
Due to recent rise in Extremism of Hindu Nationalist party in India BJP & Modi, it seems, there's a bigger ego boast in regards to that in normal populace. I have met literate people who still blindly follow his path and just don't use critical thinking.

The last name `Patel` were one of the few chosen ones in US Embassy to ban them since due to all the scams they pull off in USA. 

Community is very much structured like a communist / socialist structure, where lot of their communities help each other out if someone fails or goes out of their way to interconnect with each other. Think of it as a community dog-fooding based on a religion + state-ism.

These people in my opinion has the 2nd most asylum route for legal immigration from India, easier to work for `cash` jobs at their cousin's or extended family's business.

### Telegu

Predominately from South India, but this specific state loves to immigrate to USA, as they pride themselves to think this is the American-Indian (AI) dream. Ref. [To Prime Minister Modi - alluding to this in USA](https://youtu.be/oU4pOuA1ruU?si=RegmSsm5wjgFymU3)

Every Indian IT manager is off similar descent or upbringings. They will always create group-ism, talk in their native language & if you're a non Telegu or South indian in a team. You might suffer some non favoritism in indirect ways. 
If you have a choice, avoid is my personal opinion. Of course this is based on my personal experiences. This is the only thing I'm most conservative in my life. I do give benefit of doubt usually but history repeats itself.

These people will find loopholes to any thing moving, be it immigration, education, exams, consultancy, moonlighting (multiple jobs), taxes, office politics etc., 
I don't wanna come off as negative but yeah ask any Indian or South asian descent who had the privilege to work with them or be in their circle for extended periods of time.

### Punjabi

Then there's a third cartel in north America, Punjabi's in Canada. North Indian state (West | East Punjab, Haryana).

Stereotypes - Truck driver, Event organizers, Cab drivers.
Usually very nice people to work with compared to all other Indians. Free spirited as well.
I haven't been to Canada, so I don't know about their immigration over there. I have heard news regarding them few times. I know that they are a vote bank for Canada - Politics.

I have heard they take the most asylum route for legal immigration, since they like to work in `cash` jobs. 


### Marathi

People from Maharashtra state, I grew up in Mumbai Metro area and I do believe it has better cosmopolitan ideologies compared to other states and cities in India.

Mumbai definitely comes under top 25 cities in the world in terms of overall analysis.

## Visa Border

> The biggest immigration disaster in America is not the southern border. It’s the H1-B program tech companies are using to keep tech wages low using imported Indian labor. Immigration overhaul must include changing these programs and incentivizing corporations to help invest I education that trains a tech workforce here in America.


## Green Card

> ⁠For Indians, the people opposing h1b reforms are indian origin people who already got their citizenship /greencard.

> Nobody hates immigrants more than an immigrant that just got their legal status.


### Path to Citizenship

You have few ways of getting citizenship in United States.


- Legal Route Student (F1 ... xx) -> Work Visa (H1 ... L1 ... xx ) -> Green Card ( i140 applications ) -> Citizenship test
- Family Sponsorship Visa
- illegal Entry - Border crossing - Seek Asylum
