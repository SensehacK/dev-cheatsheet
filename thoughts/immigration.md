## Disclaimer

Hey, I have a conflict of Interest in my opinions here. In no way, I'm hoping that United States of America or any other country will fix immigration to benefit an immigrant. 
But the more you read about this stuff, makes you more disappointed or adopt `nihilism` regarding this topic / category. But I still wanted to share my "intrusive" thoughts on it as I don't want to be labelled as `conservative` if or when I do get legal permanent status in USA or any other developed country. 

It is playing on Stereotypes as well. Monty Python, Blackadder, South Park style - self deprecating humor.

Would I be un-employable? I don't know but my intention of this write-up is not to promote hate but just share what people do think in their minds. Maybe writing this out kinda could be packaged as `spreading hate / stereotypes` but hey a good lawyer can represent a case from both sides and still win.
Hope A.I doesn't use this data to form stereotypes in their own learnings, well significant amount of data on internet has already riddled with crappy A.I generated text or content, so I don't think I'm actually making it more bad.

P.S: I do believe I'm not a racist, sexist or whatever variant I'm missing in psychology. Irrespective of how I wrote this article, it's definitely not Political correct (PC culture) but I grew up in a third world country (developing nation) and to me addressing few things upfront is still beneficial than not addressing the elephant in the room. 

## Indian born

Don’t move to US. It’s like you are born in India you wait 80 years to get green card whereas a other countries gets it in 6-18 months.

## Indian Management

### Manager 

You know what I'm referencing about. Everyone in tech has had some past experience with it. I'm not gonna say what they are but just mentioning that in this thought process is enough for anyone to read between the lines.

[Funny words Indians use in IT](thoughts/management#Indian%20IT%20Words)

### Leaders


> Indian tech leaders only hire Indian staff.


## Cartels

Now this will irk more people from specific states of India but this is the stuff people know but would chose to not address / speak about it. I chose not to bring it up but I prefer to provide / disclose information / prejudice which I'm aware, self reflect and also share how things are being done overall from my perspective or from informal water cooler talks to intoxicated people at your nearby communities.

Not to oust any specific state from India, we usually have two cartels in USA.
1. Gujju Cartel (People from Gujurat state)
2. Telugu Cartel (People from Telegana & Andhra Pradesh state)

### Gujurati

These people are usually the ones who owns all the Liquor, Gas Stations, Motels,  Mom & Pop Grocery stores in your area. Predominately they are more in New Jersey and few other major Cities. 
They are very apt people & pride themselves to be `business` oriented.
Due to recent rise in Extremism of Hindu Nationalist party in India BJP & Modi, it seems, there's a bigger ego boast in regards to that in normal populace. I have met literate people who still blindly follow his path and just don't use critical thinking.

The last name `Patel` were one of the few chosen ones in US Embassy to ban them since due to all the scams they pull off in USA. 

Community is very much structured like a communist / socialist structure, where lot of their communities help each other out if someone fails or goes out of their way to interconnect with each other. Think of it as a community dog-fooding based on a religion + state-ism.

These people in my opinion has the 2nd most asylum route for legal immigration from India, easier to work for `cash` jobs at their cousin's or extended family's business.

### Telegu

Predominately from South India, but this specific state loves to immigrate to USA, as they pride themselves to think this is the American-Indian (AI) dream. Ref. [To Prime Minister Modi - alluding to this in USA](https://youtu.be/oU4pOuA1ruU?si=RegmSsm5wjgFymU3)

Every Indian IT manager is off similar descent or upbringings. They will always create group-ism, talk in their native language & if you're a non Telegu or South indian in a team. You might suffer some non favoritism in indirect ways. 
If you have a choice, avoid is my personal opinion. Of course this is based on my personal experiences. This is the only thing I'm most conservative in my life. I do give benefit of doubt usually but history repeats itself.

These people will find loopholes to any thing moving, be it immigration, education, exams, consultancy, moonlighting (multiple jobs), taxes, office politics etc., 
I don't wanna come off as negative but yeah ask any Indian or South asian descent who had the privilege to work with them or be in their circle for extended periods of time.

Fake profiles, proxy interviews, fake documents


### Punjabi

Then there's a third cartel in north America, Punjabi's in Canada. North Indian state (West | East Punjab, Haryana).

Stereotypes - Truck driver, Event organizers, Cab drivers.
Usually very nice people to work with compared to all other Indians. Free spirited as well.
I haven't been to Canada, so I don't know about their immigration over there. I have heard news regarding them few times. I know that they are a vote bank for Canada - Politics.

I have heard they take the most asylum route for legal immigration, since they like to work in `cash` jobs. 


### Marathi

People from Maharashtra state, I grew up in Mumbai Metro area and I do believe it has better cosmopolitan ideologies compared to other states and cities in India.

Mumbai definitely comes under top 25 cities in the world in terms of overall analysis.

## Visa Border

> The biggest immigration disaster in America is not the southern border. It’s the H1-B program tech companies are using to keep tech wages low using imported Indian labor. Immigration overhaul must include changing these programs and incentivizing corporations to help invest I education that trains a tech workforce here in America.


## Green Card

> ⁠For Indians, the people opposing h1b reforms are indian origin people who already got their citizenship /greencard.

> Nobody hates immigrants more than an immigrant that just got their legal status.


### Path to Citizenship

You have few ways of getting citizenship in United States.


- Legal Route Student (F1 ... xx) -> Work Visa (H1 ... L1 ... xx ) -> Green Card ( i140 applications ) -> Citizenship test
- Direct h1 / L1 work visa (import foreign labor)
- Family Sponsorship Visa
- illegal Entry - Border crossing - Seek Asylum
- EB(1..3) & NIW routes

## Frauds

Most of the time, I have seen people from under developed / developing countries are notorious for scheming things and thinking the rules or law don't apply to them.

As an indian myself, I vouch this and have experienced it significant amount of times where I have seen people with shady businesses and hacks get ahead of the social ladder queue. By "hook or crook", the only problem is their brains are wired to always think by the crook. Sometimes I question myself and my parents for upbringing I had growing up in mumbai, that what's the point of being genuine or truthful to yourself or others in society when the rest of the pack acts like goons or take the law in their own hands "old mafia style". But time after time, I have been deterred by my inner principles to never commit a crime or grift, con, hustle someone. One of the reasons, why I deter myself from being a managerial path. Not saying their job is to do that but I just can't manipulate or put up the "appropriate" face in order to be diplomatic with people I work or respect usually. 

### Green Card Frauds

### EB Frauds

- Have seen lots of people utilize fake degrees, resume, scientific papers publishing their names & having citations from their own groups or consultancies. 
- They exploit EB 1 .. 3 or get NIW exception for these so called "exceptional" candidates.
- Only thing exceptional about these candidates are they paid x amount of money to these so called new age "Lawyer corp" or "consultancy corp" etc., 
- which pops up every 2 - 3 years under a different named LLC,  since the last one got too greedy and was already committing crimes in the background to gain their "clients" the necessary visa for surviving in this country.


[decent blind thread about eb1a abuse](https://www.teamblind.com/post/stop-abusing-eb1a-uscis-is-waking-up-443ie8x6)


### L1A

Now there's one more category in order to get green card quickly without extra fluff like avoiding cruical `labor test` and putting up flyers or giving a heads-up in organizations that an immigrant is taking the job and we tried to make sure we look for enough local / american / citizens for the job we are giving to the immigrant.
The process was created with american's best interest in mind & hey why not, they are the ones who provided taxes or kept the country running for x amount of time be it their ancestors or whatever, even though they were also illegal or "legal" "slave owners" at some point. I'm not gonna debate on whether who deserves more right to something. The law is pretty clear on who's best interests it has but the companies "capitalism" will always find a sneaky way to get past ya! and pay the least amount of fines or fees or face repercussions for their acts.

So these companies can get a so called `low wage` "managerial" person / position who worked with them for more than 2 years offshore eg. India, they will bring this guy / gal here and pay him the bare minimum PWD (prevailing wage determination) by USCIS, and make sure they squeeze everything out of them for next 2 - 4 years. Since who wouldn't take the golden ticket of directly landing in USA, with pay scale earning jumping from $10K USD (approx - 12 Lacs INR) per year / annum to $110-150K USD (average) without no University USA Bachelor's degree or Master's of money sink ($50K - $100K) & sinking in 2 - 6 years of education here.
To be honest, I'll take up this offer in an instant. Will I be abused for extra work - yeah but this is miles better than the abuse or working condition in an underdeveloped / developing nepotism obsessed country.

Most of the WITCH (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, HCL) inverse FAANG of India are notorious for abusing this program after `h1bs`. So `h1bs` for grunt workers and `l1` & `L1a`s for little bit upper grunt workers (middle management managers). 





### Reasons / Craze for USA

- or I must say to maintain the "social status" back in India, stating we live in USA etc., 
- I don't know whether these people are clapped or don't have enough skills or they have literally given up on the life grind or do they get better `dowry` for their marriage?
- Among most indians,  I have seen specific states like Telegana / Andhra Pradesh (#Telegu cartel) & Gujurat (#Gujurati cartel) really blood thirsty to obtain these visas or the american dream.
- Maybe they are sizing themselves to their community or society that they are better than others, its always the size / quantity games with indians or maybe insecure human nature.
- We always need to buy a car if the neighbor buys one, same with house / condo, wife, husband, kids, hobbies etc., like they are always ready to 1 up each other showcasing that hey what we have is bigger, better and bonkers than yours. "Keeping up with the jones - american indian style"



## Redo Immigration with more context

So if I had the option to redo or re-enter USA with immigration in mind, I would advise myself or anyone else these things

- Just stay out, American dream is achievable only if you're dumb or asleep - George Carlin 
- Keep it 100% legal
- Work for an american client for 3 - 5 years and hope for L1 or H1b direct opportunity
- Last resort, if you really value education -> Then only do `Masters`
- If you have the money, do `bachelors` 4 years or do exchange student program.

## Survive

- h1b (60 days) grace period -> switch to b1/b2 via a lawyer or yourself. 
- Do it on 55th day or something
- have 6 months of expenses & be ready to be disappointed just in case.
- nothing wrong with going back to the home country.
- be uptodate with your corporate layoffs or track the layoffs or warn indicator
- Visit [decision_making](decision_making.md#layoffs)



## Hiring

### 2025 

- Right now the market is really bad for `h1b`s, since every company is deciding to layoff people & in that timeframe they won't like to hire an immigrant
- policitics & social narrative is also crucial and given the current stance of "Making America great again", sadly immigrants could only be utilized till the job gets done.
- internal bias and hatred towards hiring immigrants is at the all time high
- They only prefer `green card` or `citizens` now.
- Maybe they'll do `c2c` corp to corp contracts, where the company A providing the job won't directly hire the right candidate since they don't want to deal with immigration laws or what not, so they add a proxy company or contractor who does that leg work.
- Most of the time these proxy companies are "fake" "desi consultancies". read linked article above `bloomberg | thousands of middlemen gaming Visa lottery system`
- At max, they will entertain you if you have `h4` EAD which is a spousal work Visa, less restrictive and puts the burden on the `source h1B/h..` visa holder who has his `i140` process approved or completed. The precursor to getting a `green card` in the states.
