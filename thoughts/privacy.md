## Opt in Privacy

I dont like how these companies can just create so many settings to disable snooping your data or your privacy.
Its like in order to be healthy, you need to be dieting or take a more conscious approach towards making sure that the food you get at the supermarket isn't filled with SUGAR, High fructose, carbs or whatever is the ingredient in the big 25+ list of the label.


You need to disable other things & even if you forget 1 out of 25 things, you're privacy and security is still compromised.
Having more devices is actually a downgrade in terms of your time and keeping uptime with all these menial tasks.
We need a core framework of human privacy choices "adChoices" which gets translated well to all the platforms irrespective of ur hardware, software and political choices.
No I don't need to explicitly set `Only Necessary Cookies` for 47th time on web browser of android, iOS, iPadOS, xrOS or Windows / macOS. I'm just tired that these companies can get around their way out of providing better regulations.
The irony is, I work in ad monetization industry making these standards, designing, interfacing, codifying all these things but very things are under an engineer's or architect's hand. When the business with lawyers have given the green signal, its our job to do vanilla implementation rather than question their core beliefs or make sure it isn't aligning with privacy-first practices. We do try to influence on how the data gets collected and EU in general has been a safe haven for safeguarding our privacy but we need more activism around this as well as corps juicing / milking us out. 
In no way im frustrated with my current work life but im just saying as humans we could easily have better lifestyle physically and mentally. & not just a metric or a "user" at the end of the day.
