## Ad Greed


Quote from a thread of reddit

I can't speak for everyone but for me it's a threshold. First it was a banner ad. Then an ad before the video, then multiple ads, then unskippable ads. Now the content of some of the ads are literally spam, and in certain cases malicious. YouTube isn't policing their ads, and almost purposely making them as annoying as possible to sell premium. There's a point where it becomes too much. I felt the same way about college textbooks. I could accept paying 70$ for a 40$ book as they deserve to make a profit. But I won't pay 500.00 for a 40.00 book when they intentionally jack up the price when they know it's necessary.
