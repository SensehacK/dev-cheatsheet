# FOMO

## Crypto

Was in crypto currencies back in 2014 and never believed in it as a replacement but I definitely loved the underlying technology. 
Fast forward to pandemic with more disposable income for americans. Investing in crypto like a meme coin `dogeCoin` and making jokes about `to the moon` when the ultra hip r/fellowKids was leaking with Musk army recommendations. Suggesting anything he says is golden and people living paycheck to paycheck associating with his work ethics and projecting himself as the next Tesla scientist (Don't get me started on Tesla vs Edison) in which case this guy turned out to be the `Edison` of this generation. 

Disclaimer: 
Also I don't own any crypto and haven't lost any money to be salty about anything. 
I was not a fan of Musk back from 2017 with the Solar panels, Tesla Power Wall and its build quality of Tesla cars. No adoption of Apple Car Play and Google Android Auto.
I'm not a financial advisor either.

## Netflix - Streaming Wars

South Park creators said it right while addressing their own self of looking for better deals with TV shows seasons with HBO Max, Movie special with paramount while still tackling an actual issue about water being a limited resource in Colorado and adjacent states with Colorado river drying up and not able to meet the demand for its consumers. South Park is definitely peak witty comedy. I think so George Carlin, Jon Stewart (Daily Show),  Vir Das, Hasan Minaj, John Oliver and few other comedians come close to tackling actual issues with comedy.

## Social Media Influencers

Another great short movie special from South Park about `CRED` a parody of how social media influencers are pushing sh!tty products to kids or people who are a little bit gullible. Logan paul parody to promote energy drink to kids which should not be that popular to begin with.
