# Ecosystem

## Google

Literally kills anything which it can't monetized. Can't trust this company to keep anything active unless its a money maker or creates data mining from its end users. Google Photos started as free to train their recognition model as well as Google Captcha literally solving image based training via humans.
Give captcha and bad treatment to people who use `Firefox` and other browsers or tools aside from Google Chromium.

Adds Amp based website links to track more users and spread the narrative of its faster and compressed to save bandwidth.

### Youtube 

After buying youtube, literally it became a mess of ads infested videos. First were skippable ads, non skippable, 2 ads, podcast - long driven videos which doesn't make sense and incentivizes its creators to create more long winded videos to fill the void of loneliness. Thus good youtube video creators who were succinct are always at the mercy of the algorithm and youtube copyright fiascos.
My favorite youtuber has a great video about this topic.

## Microsoft

Very anti consumer - monopolistic practices back in the Internet explorer vs Netscape era. Bill Gates was a douche in his early 30s but then I believe he met with Warren Buffet to improve his humanity and left Microsoft as a CEO to just chairman. Bill and Melinda foundation seems pretty nice comparatively to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. 

### Windows

Till Windows 7 it was decent, no spyware, adware.
But starting from Windows 8 and 8.1 with pre-bundled games in beta releases. While Windows 10 making default Candy Crush type of games installed on my start menu. I had it with this peace of bloatware.

### Windows Gaming [PCMR](PCMR.md)

Can't wait for Linux and SteamOS to catch up with Windows in terms of great gameplay and better hardware optimization.
Only reason I keep Windows OS installed on my gaming pc is for game support.
Though Windows backwards compatibility is something else.

### [Xbox](xbox.md)

Lacks a great AAA games like Halo, Gears or Forza. Just a FPS console at this point like how Playstation games are always a clone of `Uncharted or God Of War` 3rd person console.

### Office

Standalone produce to SaaS based approach. Office 365 has basically made the transition for business users to switch to subscriptions which I hate.
MS Teams single handedly destroys `Slack` due to bundling in Office apps.
Killed Skype for one more shitty re-skin of `Teams` on it.

## Apple

### Shared notes

screw you apple ids and your walled garden ecosystem 
not even letting me share a read me text without signing me in with apple ID on a new mac or temporary mac.
This is definitely helpful when you're remote in / vnc to a mac which you want to setup quickly and have commands ready to run.
