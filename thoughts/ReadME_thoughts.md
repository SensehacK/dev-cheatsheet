## Intro

This is non scientific analysis paralysis and me just being goofy in my assumptions, statements and what not. 
Please take it with a grain of Himalyan Pink Salt! ~ the best salt there is! Trust me I'm a intermediate home cook who has 7 different types of salt at his disposal.

## Numbers

### 333 Love Odd Numbers

Trifecta 333 is always the number. Even triangle is defined as Tri ? 3 is an odd number and Triangle and Pyramids are synonomous with something illuminating ?!?!
Coincidence, I think Yes!  **brain_explosion_emoji** & if you don't know me personally I like to kid around every once in a while.


## Media

All of my media consumption history. [Tracktv](https://trakt.tv/users/sensehack)

### Movies

Movies where they make sure audio design, cinematography and engagement is prioritized. I don't care about the story since storywriters are different and actors are different.

### TV Shows

I love tv shows since it can convey time and character development. Not everything in life is perfect in that 2 hour movie screen where the hero always wins. I love to see any main character's progression or how the plot line moves. I hate Cliffhanger tactics and Game of Thrones style writing where unrelated events happen just to hype about certain things.
Good world building is crucial in TV shows and only few authors have even come close to building it right. 

#### Fanboying | Tangent 

One of those authors is Eichira Oda - Creator of One Piece. 
If you love geopolitics, society, civics, history, geography, economics, world building, emotion, drama, philosophy, wars, technology, comedy. Basically every imaginable genre you want to have. If you know things about certain topic you can reference them in this show. From Dinosaurs, Robots, Notable political figures, artists, slavery, war crimes, traditions, mythology. Everything is covered.
If you liked Lord of Rings world building and scale. One Piece is atleast 5x of that world building.

### Art

Love vincent vangough, Monet. I'm not very knowledgable about Art but I still appreciate their thought process when they are painting or conveying something.

### Music

Huge fan of Rap, since I believe good music with good beats requires poetry. Few of my favorite artists - Eminem, J.Cole, Notorious B.I.G, Big Daddy Kane, Kendrick, JayZ, Nas.

Outside of rap genre I also enjoy rock, jazz, pop. My current listening history on [lastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/Sensehack)


## Hype

## FOMO

### Crypto

Was in crypto currencies back in 2014 and never believed in it as a replacement but I definitely loved the underlying technology. 
Fast forward to pandemic with more disposable income for americans. Investing in crypto like a meme coin `dogeCoin` and making jokes about `to the moon` when the ultra hip r/fellowKids was leaking with Musk army recommendations. Suggesting anything he says is golden and people living paycheck to paycheck associating with his work ethics and projecting himself as the next Tesla scientist (Don't get me started on Tesla vs Edison) in which case this guy turned out to be the `Edison` of this generation. 

Disclaimer: 
Also I don't own any crypto and haven't lost any money to be salty about anything. 
I was not a fan of Musk back from 2017 with the Solar panels, Tesla Power Wall and its build quality of Tesla cars. No adoption of Apple Carplay and Google Android Auto.
I'm not a financial advisor either.



### Netflix - Streaming Wars

Southpark creators said it right while addressing their own self of looking for better deals with TV shows seasons with HBO Max, Movie special with paramount while still tackling an actual issue about water being a limited resource in Colorado and adjacent states with Colorado river drying up and not able to meet the demand for its consumers. Southpark is definitely peak witty comedy. I think so George Carlin, Jon Stewart (Daily Show),  Vir Das, Hasan Minaj, John Oliver and few other comedians come close to tackling actual issues with comedy. 

## Economy

This drives innovation, of course lot of other factors are present but I can't deny how globalization and open trade changed the way every other country operates. It streamlined efficient operations and encourages more collaboration. World is much closer than it was 100 years ago. Of course with economics there comes Geopolitics as well with trade wars, not conforming to open trade, stiffling innovation in capitalistic environment.

## Politics

Every country is trying one up each other. 

### GeoPolitics
Capatilism vs Communism
Late stage capatalism vs ??? 
Democracy vs Authoriatism 
Socialism vs ???


Disclaimer: I don't support War or any country.

World War I was brutal 

World War II was advance warfare in its initial stage.
Kudos to Germany for making so much advancements even after losing the first war and having to pay reparations (Treaty of Versailles) and still able to motivate their people to fight back and challenge the innovation.

It made few countries relinquish their state controlled in third world countries and signing lot of peace treaties and formation of NATO, nuclear war treaties.
Humans are really good at adapting.

Cold war is always nice to study from the technological advancements and how innovation was in a fast track after the world war II. Space era and East Germany vs West Germany.
How music also influenced lot of things.

## Immigration Rants

It is what it is! I take my cup half empty | half full ideology with being happy there is a cup to drink the beverage by. Rather than debating whether it is empty or full.
Always greatful for the opportunity this country has presented.
And yeah American dream is a dream for people who are sleeping or too ssssspid to believe in it ~ George Carlin

## Energy

Renewable energy is good to begin with but transition from Coal, Fracking Natural gas to Renewable is gonna take some time. I support Nuclear energy and not closing them this quickly since we should rely on them for the next 15 years to make the transition efficient as possible.

Hydrogen powered vehicles and net negative smart houses are great to have as well. Not just buying an electric car and using Coal, Natural gas converted electricity to power your car won't make a difference. Replacing your old gas ICE cars with an electric car strains the environment with Carbon Dioxide as well.
Hopefully we have miniature nuclear power plants and hydrogen energy. Future looks good for efficient energy.
Switch from Gas and Coiled power cooktops to induction based cooktops. Energy efficient. As well as air conditioners with heat pumps.
