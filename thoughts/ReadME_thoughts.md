## Intro

This is non scientific analysis paralysis and me just being goofy in my assumptions, statements and what not. 
Please take it with Grain of Himalyan Pink Salt! ~ the best salt there is! Trust me I'm a intermediate home cook who has 7 different types of salt at his disposal.



## Numbers

### 333 Love Odd Numbers

Trifecta 333 is always the number. Even triangle is defined as Tri ? 3 is an odd number and Triangle and Pyramids are synonomous with something illuminating ?!?!
Coincidence, I think Yes!  **brain_explosion_emoji** & if you don't know me personally I like to kid around every once in a while.

## Immigration Rants

It is what it is! I take my cup half empty | half full ideology with being happy there is a cup to drink the beverage by. Rather than debating whether it is empty or full.
Always greatful for the opportunity this country has presented.
And yeah American dream is a dream for people who are sleeping or too ssssspid to believe it ~ George Carlin

## FOMO

### Crypto

Was in crypto currencies back in 2014 and never believed in it as a replacement but I definitely loved the underlying technology. 
Fast forward to pandemic with more disposable income for americans. Investing in crypto like a meme coin `dogeCoin` and making jokes about `to the moon` when the ultra hip r/fellowKids was leaking with Musk army recommendations. Suggesting anything he says is golden and people living paycheck to paycheck associating with his work ethics and projecting himself as the next Tesla scientist (Don't get me started on Tesla vs Edison) in which case this guy turned out to be the `Edison` of this generation. 

Disclaimer: 
Also I don't own any crypto and haven't lost any money to be salty about anything. 
I was not a fan of Musk back from 2017 with the Solar panels, Tesla Power Wall and its build quality of Tesla cars. No adoption of Apple Carplay and Google Android Auto.
I'm not a financial advisor either.
