## Intro

Ranting about anything and everything

## [Big Tech Three Ecosystem](ecosystem.md)

Apple | Microsoft | Google

## Amazon

### Alexa

Bad software and doesn't care about privacy but everything else is much broader and tries to focus more on adding more features than making them work.

## Nvidia

Anti consumer practices all around, less hardware, low supply and artificial demand to gauge up pricing and stocks. 
Too much AI and very marginal improvements in different generations.
Very apple'iske way of demonstrating performance gain. 2x 3x compared to 2080ti for 3070 , 3080 but after independent reviewers called out their bull-crap about RTX benchmarks and not standard benchmarks gets butt-hurt about it. 
Ridiculous pricing and embedding proprietary `Physx` engine based approach in few games making it bad for whoever has AMD Radeon based GPUs.
Tensor and DLSs is good so I have heard. DLSS works great on my 3080Ti for few games to reach 80+fps with 4K screens upscale from 1440p Native resolution rendering.

## Intel

Runs synthetic benchmarks to masquerade high performance gains.
Long enterprise contracts to avoid OEMs to use `AMD` latest ryzen chips and anti consumer at most. Never invested in better technology and heating issues.
Too much high costs for unlocked processor `K` lineup and zero day exploits on few intel security chips.
When AMD Ryzen was on 8 and 10 nm die process Intel was still catching up - to 14 nm for so many years. Hate their `Tick - Tock` cycle of CPU upgrades as well.

## Sony

### [Playstation](playstation.md)

Bad re-releases of same games without inventing anything new. Re-releasing same stuff over and over again. Due to being number one in Xbox One vs Playstation 4 race. It added more anti consumer practices.
Like not adopting EA access or Xbox game pass (Gaming as a service). But eventually had to adapt it. Also making console exclusives or timed exclusives with 1 year for consoles. Thank god that now after having Xbox 360 backwards compatibility and Xbox Play Anywhere (One license for All Xbox consoles + PC) + Xbox Cloud saves. Made Sony to realize the competition is killing it in consumer side of things. So they finally added backwards compatibility as well as porting console exclusive games to PC. `God of War, Spiderman, Last of Us 1 and Uncharted` to name few of those Playstation system sellers.
I'm just happy that I can play these exclusive games on PC. So kudos to Playstation to listen to consumer feedback and up their game like Microsoft. Since having these 1 Gen old games on PC would make people to actually buy the new console to try the new games. Now all we need is `Bloodborne` remaster on PC.

## Nintendo

Anti consumer to the core, worse than Sony. Re - releasing same old NES, SNES or game cube / 64 games on Switch with $30, $60 price tag. Just emulating under the core. Hence I support open source projects of emulation like `CEMU` or `Yuzu` for [Nintendo Wii U](nintendo_wii_u.md) and [Switch](nintendo_switch.md) simulation.
Best console which started it all [NES](nintendo_NES.md)
