# Swift Closures

## Intro

Closures are just a short hand version of functions in a function as a parameter passing around.

It is mostly used to run asynchronous methods and execute the closure function code only after receiving certain type of input from the parent function or service. You could say it is a synchronous method calling or promises type of behavior. In swift it is referred as “Completion handlers”
