# Alignment

Difference between

## alignContent vs alignItems

So if particular items or components are in the parent container then ‘alignItems’ could be used to align the child items or components

The alignContent gets aligned something different, I may have to check with documentation.

## alignSelf

I believe alignSelf would be used to align the component which is been styled with class.

```css
alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
```

## JustifyContent

It justifies the content in vertical space \| and you can have different values to the css variable/element. I always work with

> justifyContent: 'center',

## TextAlign

One of my favorite things to work on, arranging text according to my preference, usually use it to center the text of a custom button in HTML, CSS use case scenarios.
